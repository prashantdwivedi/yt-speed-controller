- Any custom keyboard shortcuts you create
- Your theme preference (light, dark, or system)

This data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage.sync API, which may synchronize these settings across your devices if you are signed into Chrome. This data is only used to provide the extension's functionality and improve your user experience.
